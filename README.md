# dgenerate

A simple utility to stand up a kafka cluster in docker, then start a continuous flow of fake data for testing and development purposes.

## Setup 
To run do:
```
git clone git@github.com:kgorman/dgenerate.git
cd dgenerate
docker-compose up
```

This will populate the topic 'traffic' with fake internet traffic.
